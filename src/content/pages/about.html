            <p class="cs-text">
                Welcome to Somjai Thai Massage, where we bring authentic Thai massage and modern therapeutic treatments to the heart of Ross-on-Wye. Our story begins with our founder, Pen, who originates from the Surin province in Thailand.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Since moving to the UK in 2011, Pen has dedicated herself to mastering the art of massage therapy. With four years of professional experience in the UK massage industry, including valuable time at Siam Thai Spa in London's Cricklewood, she has developed a deep understanding of both traditional Thai techniques and contemporary western approaches.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Pen's commitment to excellence is reflected in her impressive qualifications, including a VTCT Level 3 Certificate in Thai Massage and a Diploma in Aromatherapy Massage. As a registered member of the Guild of Holistic Therapists (GHT), she maintains the highest standards of professional practice.
            </p>
